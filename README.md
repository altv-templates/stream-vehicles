## Disclaimer
alt:V introduced a "simple way" of streaming vehicles with v15, if you have the vehicle as a ``dlc.rpf``. If this is the case, you can just put that file inside a folder under the resources folder, name that folder and mention it in the ``server.toml`` as a resource.

We are not sure if this streams all of the files this template includes or just the files included inside the official documentation's "long way". Additionally to the officially documented files, this template includes the two meta files ``caraddoncontentunlocks.meta`` and ``vehiclelayouts_NAME.meta``.

## How to use

1. Copy the ``vehicle`` folder into your ``resources`` folder (eg. ``.../altv-server/resources/vehicle``). 
2. Rename it to anything you want (eg. ``manufacturer_modelname`` or ``group_pack``).
3. Just replace every file which exists in the modded vehicle you want to include.
4. Every file which was not included in your vehicle has to be removed manually by yourself.
5. Remove every mentioned file (meta and audio files) on the ``stream.toml`` which was not included in this add-on vehicle.
6. Rename the audio files in the ``stream.toml``.
7. Add the folder name to the ``server.toml`` as a resource.

###
    Now the vehicle should work on your server.


## Additional Notes

- Any ``NAME``, ``VARIANT`` and ``MOD`` inside the file names needs to be replaced respectively.
- The ``dlctext.meta`` is never mentioned in the ``stream.toml``.
- The meta files are mentioned as them.
- The audio sfx files are mentioned as their respective folder.
- The other audio files are mentioned grouped as ``.dat`` for every different type of them. They are most likely named with ``_amp``, ``_game`` & ``_sounds``.
- The folder structure and the file names are just examples and could be different although this is almost the same structure as suggested by the [official docs](https://docs.altv.mp/gta/articles/tutorials/stream_vehicles).
- This template includes some files that aren't officially documented by alt:V, but seem to have worked in the past (to find out which these are see "Disclaimer").


## Usage as a template

A good advice might be to have a template folder. Therefore just do step 1, but then name it something like ``_vehicle``. If helpful, you could remove all files under the ``/stream`` directory and only adjust the ``.toml`` files. The underscore will list it at the top of your folder making it easier for you to add more vehicles.


## Contributions

[Pull requests](https://github.com/altv-templates/stream-vehicles/pulls) are welcome. For explicit changes, please open an [issue](https://github.com/altv-templates/stream-vehicles/issues) first. As this is a template, we'd like to keep this as simple and polished as possible.
